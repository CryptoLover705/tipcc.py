## installing:
```python
pip install tipcc --upgrade
```

## stuff for me to work on:

-tipping does not work for whatever reason even though (i think) i followed everything the docs said.... gives 415 error (wrong media type)
-some requests are very peculiar about how the currency is specified "Bitcoin", "bitcoin", "btc", "sat" - need to make it convert it
-need to write some docs
